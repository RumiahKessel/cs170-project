# Fall 2022 CS170 Project Skeleton
This repository contains utility functions which might be helpful for solving the project.

## Requirements
`python >= 3.6` is needed for `starter.py`, which contains a handful of utility functions, to run properly; it was, nevertheless, developed in python 3.9.  
Jupyter Notebook is required should you prefer using `main.ipynb`.
